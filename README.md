### ARTstract-KG Creation and AC Image Classification

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for creating the ARTstract Knowledge Graph (AKG) and performing abstract concept (AC) image classification by integrating situated perceptual knowledge. The project aims to enhance image classification by leveraging perceptual semantic units and contextual information embedded in the AKG.

## Contents

- **ARTstract-KG_Creation:** Code and scripts for creating the ARTstract Knowledge Graph.
- **ARTstract-KG_Construction:** Resources and tools for constructing the ARTstract Knowledge Graph, including perceptual semantics detection.
- **ARTstract-KG_Frame_Enrichment:** Scripts and data for enriching the AKG with high-level linguistic frames.
- **ARTstract-ML:** Machine learning models and utilities for AC image classification.
